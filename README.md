# HTTP 1.1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS: OVERVIEW

> based on the original docs: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html

## 1. General Requirements

- **Protocol Definition**: Implement HTTP/1.1 as defined in the RFC, including the methods, status codes, headers, and message formats.
- **Conformance**: Ensure compliance with the specification, including mandatory features and behaviors.

## 2. Message Format

- **Requests and Responses**: Handle both request and response message formats, including the request line, headers, and message body.
  - **Request Line**: Method, Request-URI, and HTTP-Version.
  - **Response Line**: HTTP-Version, Status-Code, and Reason-Phrase.
  - **Headers**: Manage header fields, their parsing, and serialization.
  - **Message Body**: Handle optional message bodies and content types.

## 3. Methods

- **Supported Methods**: Implement support for methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and PATCH.
- **Method Semantics**: Ensure proper handling of each method according to its semantics.

## 4. Status Codes

- **Standard Status Codes**: Implement the standard status codes defined in the RFC (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
- **Custom Status Codes**: Optionally handle additional status codes as needed.

## 5. Header Fields

- **Standard Headers**: Implement standard header fields like `Host`, `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `User-Agent`, and `Accept`.
- **Custom Headers**: Allow custom headers as required by specific applications.
- **Header Field Parsing**: Correctly parse and handle header field values, including folded headers and multiple values.

## 6. Persistent Connections

- **Connection Management**: Support persistent connections (keep-alive) and understand the `Connection` header field for managing connection persistence.
- **Connection Close**: Handle connection closure correctly and manage `Connection: close` behavior.

## 7. Chunked Transfer Encoding

- **Chunked Encoding**: Implement support for chunked transfer encoding for responses, allowing data to be sent in chunks.
- **Chunked Encoding Parsing**: Correctly parse and process chunked data.

## 8. Content Negotiation

- **Content Negotiation**: Handle content negotiation using headers like `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, and `Accept-Charset`.
- **Response Selection**: Select the appropriate response based on client preferences.

## 9. Caching

- **Cache Control**: Implement caching mechanisms as defined by headers like `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`.
- **Validation**: Handle conditional requests and responses for cache validation.

## 10. Redirection

- **Redirects**: Support redirection status codes (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found) and handle `Location` headers for redirection.

## 11. Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms as specified by headers like `Authorization` and `WWW-Authenticate`.
- **Authorization**: Handle authorization mechanisms, including Basic and Digest authentication.

## 12. Security

- **Security Measures**: Consider security aspects such as HTTPS, proper handling of sensitive information, and prevention of common attacks.

## 13. Error Handling

- **Error Responses**: Implement proper error responses and status codes for malformed requests, unsupported methods, and other error conditions.

## 14. Protocol Upgrades

- **Upgrade Mechanism**: Support the `Upgrade` header for transitioning to other protocols if needed.

## 15. Compliance with Other RFCs

- **RFC 7230-7235**: Although RFC 9110 supersedes RFCs 7230 to 7235, ensure that implementations remain compatible with the standards established in those RFCs.

## 16. Testing and Validation

- **Compliance Testing**: Perform thorough testing to ensure conformance to RFC 9110 and interoperability with other HTTP/1.1 implementations.

## 17. Error Logging and Diagnostics

- **Logging**: Implement logging for debugging and diagnostics purposes, capturing request and response details, errors, and other relevant information.

## 18. Performance Considerations

- **Optimization**: Optimize implementation for performance, including efficient parsing, connection management, and data handling.

Implementing HTTP/1.1 requires careful attention to detail and adherence to the RFC specifications. Be sure to thoroughly test and validate your implementation to ensure it behaves correctly under various scenarios.
