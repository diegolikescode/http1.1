# HTTP 1.1 WITH JAVA

> based on the original docs: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html

### IDEA

- create this custom HTTP module that can handle HTTP 1.1 requests;
- setup as a dependency so it can be used as the HTTP library of a project;
- use this HTTP library to run a basic HTTP server;
- run a stress/load test in the server created;
